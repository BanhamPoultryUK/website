			<p>As a company, we operate primarily in the fresh retail sector, but still maintain our traditional links to the wholesale and export markets.  In an ever-changing market place we are constantly updating our manufacturing process to maintain our reputation as market leaders in both quality and service. We were the first UK Company to offer leak proof packaging for whole bird with the Ulma pacific flow wrapper.  We have recently invested heavily in IQF production for retail, wholesale and export markets.  This is part of an onward investment programme aimed at maintaining our market strength.</p>
